        <h1> Backtracking</h1>
        <p> Backtracking is a form of recursion.</p>
        <p> The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you must choose one of these. After
                you makw your choice you will get a new set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what
                choice you made. This procedure is repeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you made a
                good sequence of choices, your final state is a goal state; if you didn't, it isn't.</p>
        <p> Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good leaves and some bad leaves,
                though it may be that the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node,
                begginning with the root, you choose of of its children to move to, and you keep this up until you get
                to a leaf.</p>
        <p> Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your
                most recent choice, and trying out the next option in that set of options. If you run out of options,
                revoke the choice that got you here,and try another choice at that node, If you end up at the root with
                no options left, there are no good leaves to be found.</p>
        <p>This need an example</p>

       <ol type="1">
                <li> Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</li> <br>

                <li> At, your options are C and D. You choose C. </li> <br>

                <li> C is baf. Go back to A.</li><br>

                <li>At A, you have already tired C, and it failed. Try D.</li><br>

                <li> D is bad. Go back to A.</li><br>

                <li> At A, you have no options, left to try. Go back to Root.</li><br>

                <li> At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li><br>

                <li> At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li><br>

                <li>E is good. Congratulations!</li><br>

        <p>In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model of the possible sequences
                of choices we could make. There is a also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't
                have a data structure to tell us what choices we have.(If we do have an actual tree data
                structure, backtracking on it is called depth-first tree searching.)</p>
        <h2>The backtracking algorithm.</h2>
        <pre> <style></style>
                       
               co </pre>
        <p>Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean function. This is essential to understanding the
                algorithm. if solve(n) is true, that means node n is part of a solution--that is, node n is one of the
                nodes on a path from the root to some goal node. We say that n is solveble. if solve(n) is false(n),
                then there is no path that includes n to any goal node. </p>
        <h3> How does this work ?</h3>
        <ul>
                <li> If any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable.</li>
                <li>If no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable( part of a path to a goal node), all you have to do
                is test whether any child of n is solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of n, in the above
                code, this is done by the lines.</p>
                <pre style="color: rgb(0, 166, 255);">
                        for each child c of n{
                                if solve(n) succeeds, return true
                        } return false
                </pre>
        <p>
                Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out at a leaf node. if the leaf node is a goal node, it is
                solvable, if the leaf node a not a goal node, it is not solvable. This is our base case, in the above
                code, this is done by the lines.
        </p>
        <pre style="color: rgb(0, 166, 255);">
                if n is a leaf node{
                        if the leaf is a goal node, return true
                        else return false
                     }
             </pre>
        <p> The backtracking algorithm is simple but important. You should understant it thoroughly.Another way of
                starting it is as follows. </p>
        <h3>
                <ul> To search a tree:</ul>
        </h3>
        <ol type="1">
                <li>If the tree consists of a single leaf, test whether it is a goal node.</li>
                <li>Otherwise, search the subtrees until you find one containing a goal node, or until you have searched
                        them all unsuccessfully.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Non-recursive backtracing, using a stack</h2>
        <p>Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive algorithm can be rewritten as a stack
                algorithm. In fact, that is how your recursive algorithms are translated into machine or assembly
                language.</p>
        <pre style="color: rgb(0, 166, 255);">
                boolean solve(Node n)
                        put node n on the stack;
                        while the stack is not empty{
                                if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf{
                                        if it is a goal node, return true
                                        else pop it off the stack
                                }
                                else{
                                        if the node at the top of the stack has untried children
                                        push th enext untired child onto the stack 
                                        else pop the node off the stack
                                }
                                return false
                        }
            </pre>
        <p>Startingfromthe root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are the children of the node currently
                on the the top of the stack, and these are only pushed on one child at a time, hence, the nodes on the
                stack at all times describe a valid path in the tree. Nodes are removed from the stack only when that
                they have no goal nodes among their descendents. therefore, if the root node gets removed (making the
                stack empty), there must have been no goal nods at all, and no solution to me problem.</p>
        <p> When the stack algorithm terminates successfully the nodes on the stack from (in reverse order) a path from
                the root to a goal node.</p>
        <p>Similarly, when the recursive finds a goal nide, the path information is embedied (in revese order) in the
                sequence of recursive calls. THus as the recursion unwinds, the path can be recovered one node at a
                time, by ( for instance) printing the node at the current level, or storing it in an array.</p>
        <p> Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm, modified slightly to print ( in reverse order) the nodes along
                the successful path:

        <h2>Keeping backtracing simple</h2>
        <p>All of these versions of the backtrackimg algorithm are pretty simple, but when applied toa a real problem,
                they can get pretty cluttered up with details. Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be
                complex:</p>
        <p> For example, if the path represents a series of moves in a chess endgame problem, the leaves are the
                checkmate and stalemate solution.</p>
        <p>To keep the program clean, therefore, tests like this should be buried in method, ina chess game, for
                example, you could test whether a node is a leaf by writing a <strong>gameOver method</strong> (or you
                coukd even call it <strong> isleaf).</strong> This method would encapsulate all the ugly details of
                figuring out whether any possible moves remain.</p>
        <p>Notice that the backtracking althorithms require us to keep trck, for each node on the current path, which of
                its children have been tried already (so we don't have to try them again). In the above code we made
                this look simple, by just saying <strong> for each child c of n.</strong> In reality, it may be
                difficult to figure out what the possible children are, and there may be no obvious way to step through
                them. In chess, for example, a node can represent one arrangement of pieces on achessboard, and each
                child of that node can represent the arrangment after some piece has made a legal move. How do you find
                these children, and how do you keep track of which ones you've already examined? </p>
        <p> The most straightforword way to keep of which track of which children of the node been tired is as follows:
                Upon initial entry to the node (that it, when you first get there above), make a list of all its
                children. As you try each child, take it off the list. When the list is empty, there are no remainig
                untried children, and you can return "failure." This is a simple approach, but it may require quite a
                lot of additional work.

        </p>
        <p>There is an easier way t keep track of which children have been tried, if you can define an ordering on the
                children. If there is an ordering, and you know which child you just tired, you can determine which
                child to try next. </p>
        <p>For example, you might be able to number the <strong>children 1 through n,</strong> and try them in numerical
                order. Then, if you have just tried <strong> child k,</strong> you know that you have already tried
                children 1 through <strong>k-1,</strong> and you have not yet trid children <strong> k+1</strong>
                through <strong>n.</strong>Or, if you are trying to color a map with just four colors, you can always
                try <strong> red first, then yellow, then green, then blue.</strong> If child yellow fails, you know to
                try child green next. If you are searching a maze, you can try order left,straight, right <strong>(or
                        perhaps north, east, south, west).</strong> </p>
        <p>It isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a node. <strong>(In the chess game
                        example,)</strong> you might number your pieces (or perhaps the sequares of the board) and try
                them in numerical order; but in addition each piece may also have several moves, and these must also be
                ordered. </p> <br>
        <h3>Example: Tree Search</h3>
        <p> For starters,let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking, which is searching an actual tree. We
                will also use the simplest kind of tree, a binary tree.</p>
        <br>
        <p>A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes. One node is designated as the node. Each node can
                reference (point to) zero, one,or two other nodes, which are called its children. Then children are
                referred to as the left child and/or the right child. All nodes are reachable (by one or more steps)
                from, we will say that a node might or might not be a goal node, and will contain its name. The first
                example in this paper (which we repeat here) shows a binary tree.</p>
        <p>Here's a definition of the BinaryTree class.</p>
        <pre style="color: rgb(0, 166, 255);">
                public class BinaryTree{
                BinaryTree leftChild = null;
                BinaryTree rightChild = null;
                boolean isGoalNode = false;
                String name;
                <br>
                BinaryTree{Strign name, BinaryTree left, BinaryTree right, boolean isGoalNode } {
                        this.name = name;
                leftChild = left;
                rightChild = right;
                this.isGoalNode = isGoalNode;
                }
                
           }
           </pre>
        <p>Next we will create a TreeSearch cless, and in it we will define a method makeTree() which constructs the
                above binary tree.</p>

                        c = new BinaryTree("C", null, faise);

                if they do. Here's that alternative version:</p>

        <h3> What are the chidren?</h3>
        <p>One of the things that simpilifies the above bianry tree search is that,at each choice point, you can ignore
                all the previous choices. Previous choices don't give you any information about what you should do next;
                as far as you know,both the left and the right child are possible solutions. In many problems, however,
                you may be able to eliminate children immediately, without recursion.</p>
        <p>Consider, for example, the problem of four-coloring a map. It is a theorem of mathematics that any map on a
                plane, no matter how convolutes the countries are, can be colored with at most at most four colors, so
                that no two countries that share a border are the colored.</p>
        <p> There are two ways to do this:</p>
        <ul>
                <li>Method 1. Try each of the four possible colors, and recur. When you run out of countries, check
                        whether you are at a goal node.</li>
                <li> Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an adjacent country, and recur.
                        If and when you run out of countries. you have successfully colored the map.</li>

        <p>Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a checkrboard. THis should be easily
                solvable; after all, a checkerboard only needs two colors.</p>

        <p>Used by method 1 to check (at a leaf node) whether the entire map is colored coorectly.</p>
        <h4> boolean okToColor(int row, int column, int color)</h4>
        <p>Used by method 2 to check, at every node, whether there is an adjacent node already colored with the given
                color.</p>
        <h4>int[] nextRowAndColumn(int row,int column)</h4>
        <p> Used by both methods to find the next " country" (actually, the row and column of the next sequre on the
                checkerboard).</p>
        <br>
        <p>Here's the code for method 1:</p>

                boolean explore1(int row, int column, int color){

                        map[row][column] = color;
                        for (int nextColor = RED; nextColor <= BLUE; nextColor++){
                                int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row, column);
                                if (explore1(next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return ture;

        <p> The zeros in the above table indicate times too short to measure ( less than 1 millsecond). Why this huge
                difference? Either of these methods could have exponential growth. Eliminating a node automatically
                eliminate all of its descendents, and this will often prevent exponentil. Eliminating a node
                automatically eliminate all of its descendents, and this will often prevent exponential growth.
                Conversely, by waiting to check until a leaf node is reached, exponential growth is practically
                guaranteed. If there is any way to eliminate children( reduce the set of choices), do so! </p>

        <h2> Debugging techniques</h2>
        <p> Often our first try at a program doesn't work, and we need to debug it. Debuggers are helpful, but sometimes
                we need to fail back on inserting print stalemate. There are some simple tricks to making effective use
                of print statements. These tricks can be applied to any program, but are especially useful when you are
                trying to debug recursive routines.</p>
        <h4>Trick #1: Indent when you print method entries and exist.</h4>
        <p>Often, the best debugging technique is to print every method call and return (or at least the most important
                ones). You probably want to print, for each method, what parameters it came in with, and what value it
                leaves with. However, if you just print a long list of these, it's hard to match up method exist with
                their corresponding entries. Indenting to show the level of nesting can help. </p>
        <h4>Trick #2: Use specialized print methods for debugging.</h4>
        <p> Don't clutter up your actual code more than you must. Also, remember that code inserted for debugging
                purposes can itself contain bugs, or( in hte worst case) can affect the results, so be very careful with
                it.</p> <br>
        <p>Here's our debugging code. For this trivial program, there's almost more debugging code than actual code, but
                in larger programs the proportions will be better.</p>
                <pre style="color: rgb(0, 166, 255);">
        stati String indent = "";
<br>
static String name(BinaryTree node){
        if (node == null) return null;
        else return node, name;
}
static void enter(BinaryTree node){
        System.out.printIn(indent + "Entering solvable("+ name(node)+")");
        indent = indent +"|";
}
static boolean yes(BinaryTree node){
        indent = indent.substring(3);
        System.out.printIn(indent +"solvable("+name(node)+ ")return true");
        return true;
}
static boolean no(BinaryTree node){
        indent = indent.substring(3);
        System.out.printIn(indent+ "solvable("+name(node)+")return false");
        reutrn false;
}
</pre>
        <p>To use this code, we modify solcable as followa:</p>
        <pre style="color: rgb(0, 166, 255);">
        static coolean solvable(BinaryTree node){
                enter(node);
                if (node == null) return no(node);
                if (node.isGoaiNode) return yes(node);
                if(solvable(node.leftChild))return yes(node);
                if(solvable(node.rightChild))return yes(node);
                return no(node);
        }
</pre>
<pre style="color: rgb(0, 166, 255);">
And we get these results:
  Entering solvable(Root)
  | Entering solvable(A)
  ||Entering solvable(C)
  |||Entering solvable(null)
  ||| solvable(null) return false
  |||solvable(C) return false
  |||Entering solvable(D)
  |||Entering solvable(null)
  |||solvable(null) return false
  |||solvable(D)return false 
  |solvable(A) return false
  |Entering solvable(B)
  ||Entering solvable(E)
  ||solvable(E) returns true
  |solvable(B) return true
  solvable(Root) returns true
  true
</pre>
        <h4>Trick #3: Never discard your debugging statements.</h4>
        <p>Writing debugging statements is programming, too.Often it's as much work to debugging the debugging
                statements as it is to debug the actual program.Once your program is working, why throw this code away?
        </p>
        <p> Obviously, you don't want to print out all this debugging information from a program you are ready to
                submit(or to turn over to your manager). You could comment out your debugging calls, but that can be a
                lot of work. What's more, in the above example, you would have to replace every return(yes(node)) with
                return(true), and every return(no(node)) with return false. With all these changes, you might introduce
                new bugs into your program.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The simple solution is to make your debugging ststements conditional. For example,</p>
        <pre style="color: rgb(0, 166, 255);">
        Statis final boolean debugging = false;

static void enter (BinaryTree node){
        if (debugging){
                System.out.printIn(indent + "Entering solvsble("+ name(node)+")");
                indent = indent +"|";
        }
}
static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) {
        if(debugging){
                indent = indent.substring(3);
                System.out.printIn(indent + "solvable("+ name(node) +")return true");
        }
        retuen true;
}
static boolean no(BinaryTree node){
        if (debugging){
                indent = indent.substring(3);
                System.out.printIn(indent + "solvable("+ name(node)+ ")return false");
        }
        return false;
}
</pre>
        <p>In industry, actual programs often have multiple flags to control different aspects of debugging. Don't worry
                too mush about making your code larger, modern compilers will notice that since the variable debugging
                is final, it can never be true, and the controlled code will be discarded.</p>
        <h4> Trick #4: Create an Exception.</h4>
        <p>If an Exception is thrown, you ca get information about just where it happened by sending it the message
                printStackTraceStream(PrintStream), Since an Exception is an object like any other, you can create and
                throw your own Exceptions. However, Java programmers don't always realize that you can create an without
                throwing it. For example, the following code.</p>
                <pre style="color: rgb(0, 166, 255);">new Exception("Checkpoint Charlie").printStackTrace(System.out);</pre>
        <p>will print out a message something like this, and the prohram will then continue normally. That is, the above
                code just acts like a print statements </p>
                <pre style="color: rgb(0, 166, 255);">

        <strong> Stuck!</strong>
        <p>The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean.In solvable we shall need to check whether we
                are at a leaf, which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't
                so easy.</p>
        <p>Now to the program.The main program will initialize the board, and call a recursive backtracking routine to
                attempt to solve the puzzle. The backtracking routine will either succeed and print out a winning path,
                or it will fail, and the main program will have to print out the bad news.</p>
        <p>The backtracking methosd is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether
                we are at a leaf, which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This
                isn't so easy.</p>
        <p>Each possible move will result in a new board position, and these new board positions are the children of the
                current board possition. Hence to find the children of a node( That is, of a board position), we need
                only find the possible moves from that node. Remember that it is also highly desirable to find an
                ordering on these possible moves.</p>
        <p>Here it is time to stop and take thought. To make progress, we must analyze the game to some extent. Probably
                a number of approaches would work, and what follows is based on the way. I worked it out. if you were to
                program this puzzle, you might find a different but equally valid approach.</p>
        <p>First, notice that if a marble has a move, that move is unique: if it can move ahead one square, then it
                cannot jumps. If it can jumps, it cannot move ahead one square. This suggests that, to find the possible
                move, we might assign numbers the marbles, and check each marble in turn. When we have looked at all the
                marbles, we have looked at all the possible moves. This would require having a table to keep track of
                where each marble is, or else somehow "marking" each marble with its number and searching the board each
                time to find the marble we want. Neither alternative is very attractive.</p>
        <p>Next, notice that for a given board position, each marble occupies a unique space. Hence, instead of talking
                anout moving a particular marble, we can talk about moving the marbles in a particular space. If a move
                is possible from a given space, then that must be the only move possible from that space, because if the
                marble in that space has a move, it is unique.There is a slight complication because not every space
                contains a marble, but at least the spaces(unlike the marbles) stay in one place.</p>
        <p><strong> Now we have a simpler ordering of moves to use in our program. Just check, in order, the 2n+1 spaces
                        of the board. For each space, either zero or one moves is possible.With this understandin, we
                        can write a boolean method canMove(int[] board, int possition) which determines whether a move
                        is possible from the given positon:</strong></p>
        <ul>
                <li>If the position is empty, no move is posible;</li>
                <li>If the position contains a black marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the right;</li>
                <li>If the positions a white marble,the method checks for a move or just to the left.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> We write another method <strong> int[] makeMove(int[] oldBoard, int position)</strong> that will take a
                board and a position, make a move from that position, and return as its value a new board. (We could
                write this somewhat more efficienctly by changing the old board, rather than creating a new one, but
                here we aremore concerned with simplicity.) In technical jargon, makeMove is "applicative" rather than
                "mutaive."</p>
        <p>Along with <strong>canMove and makeMove,</strong> we are using methods <strong>puzzleSolved and
                        printBoard</strong> with meanings that shoukd be obvious.</p>

        <p>Notice that the solution is given in reverse order: BLACK starts out on the left and WHITE on the right, as
                in the last line. I'vw added line munbers to the actual output in order to empphasize this point.
                Bcktracking always produces its results (sequences of choices) in revers order; it is up you, the
                programmer, to reverse the results again to get them in the correct oreder.</p>
